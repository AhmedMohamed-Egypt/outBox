Visual automated testing of a WebGL/WebGPU web application and its UI is a complex problem to solve. There are several obstacles to overcome to reach the goal:


- -&nbsp;headless run with GPU capabilities enabled
- -&nbsp;synchronizing and gathering reports in a cloud
- -&nbsp;robust analysis of screenshots or better-avoiding screenshots
- -&nbsp;getting high performance despite extra restrictions visual testing imply
- -&nbsp;performance testing and benchmarking

<h3 class="w-500 size-20 p-15 black">Some technologies we use to solve such kinds of problems:</h3>

- -&nbsp;Chrome remote protocol
- -&nbsp;Puppeteer
- -&nbsp;OpenCV if required
- -&nbsp;TensorFlow if required
- -&nbsp;BrowserStack if required
- -&nbsp;GitHub Workflows if required
- -&nbsp;GitHub Workflows if required
- -&nbsp;CircleCI if required
